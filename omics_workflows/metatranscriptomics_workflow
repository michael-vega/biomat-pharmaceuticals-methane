### This workflow describes the generic metatranscriptomics pipeline used for the manuscript, "Methane-Oxidizing Activity Enhances Sulfamethoxazole Biotransformation in a Benthic Constructed Wetland Biomat".

### Additional details and steps are described in the manuscript and supporting information, as well as on The Wrighton Lab GitHub page: https://github.com/TheWrightonLab/

### Download filtered metatranscriptomic reads: NCBI and JGI Gold Accessions are available in Table S7 of the manuscript

### The majority of commands were performed using a Slurm job management system

### All commands use default parameters if not specified

### Packages / Softwares Used ###
		#Sickle [v1.33]: https://github.com/najoshi/sickle
		#bbmap [v38.70]: https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/
		#HTSeq [v0.12.4]: https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/

-----------------------
### Begin Workflow ###

1. Unzip JGI filtered reads using gunzip
	Inputs: zipped filtered reads files
	Outputs: unzipped filtered reads files

2. Deinterleave forward and reverse reads from the unzipped fastq file from Step 1 using deinterleave_fastq.sh
	Inputs: filtered reads file from Step 1
	Outputs: deinterleaved forward and reverse reads 

3. Trim the filtered reads from JGI using sickle
	Inputs: forward and reverse reads from Step 2
	Outputs: trimmed forward and reverse reads
	Parameters: pe, -t = Sanger

4. Create reference from assembly for read mapping using bbmap
	Inputs: MAG database (dereplicated medium and high quality only) from metagenomics workflow
	Outputs: reference index from assembly 

5. Map filtered and trimmed reads to MAG database using bbmap
	Inputs: trimmed reads from Step 3, bbmap reference index from Step 4 
	Outputs: sam files
	Parameters: ambiguous = toss, usejni = t, length tag = t, idtag = t, idfilter = 0.99, printunmappedcount =t

6. Convert sam files to bam files using 'samtools view'
	Inputs: sam files from Step 5
	Outputs: bam files

7. Sort bam files using 'samtools sort'
	Inputs: bam files from Step 6
	Outputs: sorted bam files

8. Count how many mapped metaT reads mapped to the concatenated MAG gene database (i.e., .gff files from DRAM) using HTSeq-count
	Inputs: sorted bam file from Step 7, .gff files from DRAM annotation of MAGs (metagenomics workflow)
	Outputs: counts text file to be imported into R for downstream analyses
